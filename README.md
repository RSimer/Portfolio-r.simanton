# Overview
Creating a project from scratch. This project both increased my confidence in coding while simultaneously destroying that confidence to teach me that I have a lot to learn. I learned how to create a style (still neeeds work) and allowing myself to find out answers for myself from resources from all over.

# Tasks Completed

* Working nav bar

* Stylized about me and flex box

* Working footer section

* Developed website


# Motivation for Creation

Building a website has been somewhat of a goal of mine. I always thought it was a marker that set yourself apart from other candidates, I wanted to create a website through squarespace for a time but who wants to spend $1o a month when you can go through coding bootcamp. I loved the creativity I was allowed throughout this product, this program turly allows sutdents to express themselves.

# Usage
Im sorry you have to look at this.
